Sentiment Analysis: Understanding Emotional Tone in Text
Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a process of determining the emotional tone behind a piece of text. It is widely used in natural language processing (NLP) to interpret human emotions in written content. The goal is to identify whether the sentiment expressed in a given text is positive, negative, or neutral. In more advanced applications, sentiment analysis can also detect specific emotions like joy, anger, fear, or sadness
